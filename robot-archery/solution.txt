Four robots take it in turns to generate a number between 0 and 1 at random. If it is lower than the best score then it becomes the new best score. Otherwise that robot is eliminated. This is repeated, with the same robot order, excluding any eliminated robots, until only one robot is left. Best score is not reset between rounds. The best score begins at 1.

Round 1 ranking possibilities (each equally likely because the robots have the same probability function):

Round ranking possibilities given best score P:

(notation: uppercase means the robot got lower than the best score, lowercase means it did not.)
