3N robots, N races

Xj = ways that 3N robots can pick j races = j^3N

Yj = ways that 3N robots can pick N races such that j specific races are empty = X[N-j]

Zj = ways that 3N robots can pick N races such that j races are empty

A = ways that 3N robots can pick N races such that at least 1 race is empty

A = Nc1*Y1 - Nc2*Y2 + Nc3*Y3 - ... +/- Nc(N-1)*Y[N-1] (uses inclusion-exclusion)
